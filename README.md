# Overview

A simple command-line DOS program to test the Know-It-All ID-SDK Raman API from VC++.

This was adapted from the ID-SDK "sample code" posted here:

- https://info.bio-rad.com/KnowItAllSDK.html

The goal will be to extend this to make it easy to call from ENLIGHTEN via Python.

# API

See vendor docs here:
